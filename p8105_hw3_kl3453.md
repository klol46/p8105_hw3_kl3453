# Problem \# 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

## Write a short description of the dataset,

…noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key
variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.

- The dataset instacart contains 1384617 observations and 15 variables.

- The dataset describes some form of online ordering system that keeps
  track of what is purchase in one order, how many, and what product as
  well as where the product is located by store department and aisle.

- The dataset has many repeating rows for the same order and thus
  untidy, in the long form.

- Some key varaibles include the order_id (perhaps the designation for a
  certain shopper’s order), product_id (what the shopper ordered),
  user_id (designation for the shopper), department (the store
  department where the item is located), and aisle (the store aisle
  where the item is located).

- For example, here is the order for shopper 112108 with their order id
  1.

``` r
instacart |> 
  select(product_id, order_id, user_id, product_name, aisle, department) |> 
  head(8)
```

    ## # A tibble: 8 × 6
    ##   product_id order_id user_id product_name                      aisle department
    ##        <int>    <int>   <int> <chr>                             <chr> <chr>     
    ## 1      49302        1  112108 Bulgarian Yogurt                  yogu… dairy eggs
    ## 2      11109        1  112108 Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole Milk C… othe… dairy eggs
    ## 3      10246        1  112108 Organic Celery Hearts             fres… produce   
    ## 4      49683        1  112108 Cucumber Kirby                    fres… produce   
    ## 5      43633        1  112108 Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive… cann… canned go…
    ## 6      13176        1  112108 Bag of Organic Bananas            fres… produce   
    ## 7      47209        1  112108 Organic Hass Avocado              fres… produce   
    ## 8      22035        1  112108 Organic Whole String Cheese       pack… dairy eggs

- There are 39123 products from 131209 orders from 131209 distinct
  users.

## Then, do or answer the following:

### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

- There are 134 aisles.

The aisles that are the most ordered are:

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head(3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 2
    ##   aisle                           n
    ##   <chr>                       <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables           150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits               150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits  78493

### Make a plot that…

shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles
with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and
organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

### Make a table…

showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking
ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include
the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

### Make a table…

showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee
Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for
human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |
