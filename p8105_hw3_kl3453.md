# Problem \# 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

## Write a short description of the dataset,

…noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key
variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.

- The dataset instacart contains 1384617 observations and 15 variables.

- The dataset describes some form of online ordering system that keeps
  track of what is purchase in one order, how many, and what product as
  well as where the product is located by store department and aisle.

- The dataset has many repeating rows for the same order and thus
  untidy, in the long form.

- Some key varaibles include the order_id (perhaps the designation for a
  certain shopper’s order), product_id (what the shopper ordered),
  user_id (designation for the shopper), department (the store
  department where the item is located), and aisle (the store aisle
  where the item is located).

- For example, here is the order for shopper 112108 with their order id
  1.

``` r
instacart |> 
  select(product_id, order_id, user_id, product_name, aisle, department) |> 
  head(8)
```

    ## # A tibble: 8 × 6
    ##   product_id order_id user_id product_name                      aisle department
    ##        <int>    <int>   <int> <chr>                             <chr> <chr>     
    ## 1      49302        1  112108 Bulgarian Yogurt                  yogu… dairy eggs
    ## 2      11109        1  112108 Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole Milk C… othe… dairy eggs
    ## 3      10246        1  112108 Organic Celery Hearts             fres… produce   
    ## 4      49683        1  112108 Cucumber Kirby                    fres… produce   
    ## 5      43633        1  112108 Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive… cann… canned go…
    ## 6      13176        1  112108 Bag of Organic Bananas            fres… produce   
    ## 7      47209        1  112108 Organic Hass Avocado              fres… produce   
    ## 8      22035        1  112108 Organic Whole String Cheese       pack… dairy eggs

- There are 39123 products from 131209 orders from 131209 distinct
  users.

## Then, do or answer the following:

### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

- There are 134 aisles.

The aisles that are the most ordered are:

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head(3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 2
    ##   aisle                           n
    ##   <chr>                       <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables           150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits               150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits  78493

### Make a plot that…

shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles
with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and
organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_kl3453_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" />

### Make a table…

showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking
ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include
the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

### Make a table…

showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee
Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for
human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem \#2

``` r
#Import brfss data and convert into tibble dataframe
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_smart2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  as_tibble()
```

### **First**, do some data cleaning:

- format the data to use appropriate variable names;

``` r
#COnvert variable names into snakecase
brfss_smart2010 =
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

- focus on the “Overall Health” topic

``` r
#Filter responses where topic == "OVerall Health Only"
brfss_overall_health =
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health")

# brfss_overall_health |>
#   group_by(response) |> 
#   count()
```

- include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”:

``` r
#Filter to include only responses that contain "Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"
brfss_overall_health = 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(response == "Poor" | 
           response == "Fair" | 
           response == "Good" | 
           response == "Very good" | 
           response == "Excellent"
         )
```

- organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
  “Excellent”:

``` r
#Convert variable type from char to factor
brfss_overall_health =
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  mutate(response = factor(
    response, 
    #we define the levels to have the 5 response types.
    levels = c ("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"), 
    #the categorical variable "response" is ordered so we indicate it as so
    ordered = TRUE)
    )
```

### Using this dataset, do or answer the following:

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
state20027cnt = 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(year == 2002) |>   #filter to include responses in 2002 only
  group_by(locationabbr) |>  #group by the state abbreviations
  summarize(num = n()) |>    #summarize the different response types 
  mutate(num = num/5) |>     #we know that there are 5 responses per location so we can get the number by                                   dividing
  arrange(desc(num))         #arrange by descending order for viewing ease

#output a table that shows stsates that have more than 7 locations and a state that had 6
state20027cnt |> 
  head(7) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| locationabbr | num |
|:-------------|----:|
| PA           |  10 |
| MA           |   8 |
| NJ           |   8 |
| CT           |   7 |
| FL           |   7 |
| NC           |   7 |
| MD           |   6 |

- In 2002, PA, MA, NJ, CT, FL, and NC were states that were observed at
  7 or more locations

``` r
state20107cnt = 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(year == 2010) |>   #filter to include responses in 2010 only
  group_by(locationabbr) |>  #group by the state abbreviations
  summarize(num = n()) |>    #summarize the different response types 
  mutate(num = num/5) |>     #we know that there are 5 responses per location so we can get the number by                                   dividing
  arrange(desc(num))         #arrange by descending order for viewing ease

#output a table that shows stsates that have more than 7 locations and a state that had 6
state20107cnt |>
  head(15) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| locationabbr | num |
|:-------------|----:|
| FL           |  41 |
| NJ           |  19 |
| TX           |  16 |
| CA           |  12 |
| MD           |  12 |
| NC           |  12 |
| NE           |  10 |
| WA           |  10 |
| MA           |   9 |
| NY           |   9 |
| OH           |   8 |
| CO           |   7 |
| PA           |   7 |
| SC           |   7 |
| ID           |   6 |

- In 2010, FL, NJ, TX, CA, MD, NC, NE, WA, MA, NY, OH, CO, PA, and SC,
  were states that were observed at 7 or more locations.

### Construct a dataset that is limited to…

Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, and a variable that
averages the `data_value` across locations within a state. Make a
“spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state (that
is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the
geom_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss_avg = 
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  select(year, locationabbr, response, data_value) |>
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |> 
  summarize(mean_data = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
brfss_avg |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = locationabbr), alpha = .5)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_kl3453_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="90%" />

### Make a two-panel plot showing…

for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data_value for responses
(“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.

``` r
#NY in 2006
brfssNY2006 =
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(year == 2006) |> 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY")

#Plot
brfssNY2006plot = 
  brfssNY2006 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = locationdesc)) +
  geom_point()

#NY in 2010
brfssNY2010 =
  brfss_overall_health |> 
  filter(year == 2010) |> 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY")

brfssNY2010plot =
  brfssNY2010 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = locationdesc)) +
  geom_point()

brfssNY2006plot + brfssNY2010plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_kl3453_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="90%" />

# Problem 3

``` r
#Import data + clean

#Retains the variable labels/details
demo_raw = 
  read_csv("./data/nhanes_covar.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## New names:
    ## Rows: 254 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification
    ## ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: "," chr
    ## (5): ...1, 1 = male, ...3, ...4, 1 = Less than high school
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ

    ## • `` -> `...1`
    ## • `` -> `...3`
    ## • `` -> `...4`

``` r
demo = 
  read_csv("./data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4) |>

```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5

    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (5): SEQN, sex, age, BMI, education
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
accel = 
  read_csv("./data/nhanes_accel.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets.

Your final dataset should include all originally observed variables;
exclude participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind).

``` r
#Tidy 

## Tidy Accel (Long)
accel_wide = 
  accel |> 
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "minuteofday", 
    values_to = "mimsaccel")
```

- We tidy accel in order to allow it to merge with demo data.

``` r
## Filter Demo
demo_filter =
  demo |>
  
  #Filter
  filter(age >= 21) |> #keep those that are 21 y/o or older
  filter(!is.na(education)) |> #filter out missing demograph (education) data
  filter(!is.na(sex)) |> 
  
  #Factor - Education
  mutate(education = factor(
    education, 
    #we define the levels to have 3 education categories
    levels = c (1, 2, 3), 
    #the categorical variable "education" is ordered so we indicate it as so
    ordered = TRUE)
    ) |> 
  
  #Factor - Gender
  mutate(sex = factor(
    sex,
    levels = c (1,2),
    ordered = TRUE)
  )
```

- Filter out \<21 y/o and missing demographic (eduation) variables
- Apply factors to categorical variables, sex and education.

``` r
#Merge
accel_demo =
  left_join(demo_filter, accel_wide, by = "seqn")
```

## Produce a reader-friendly table…

for the number of men and women in each education category, and create a
visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each
education category. Comment on these items.

``` r
#Clean Data
men_women_edu = 
  demo_filter |> 
  group_by(education) |> 
  count(sex)

#Plot
men_women_edu_plot =
  men_women_edu |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = education, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_point()
```
